Cloud functions are the back-end code is stored on some servers such as Google Cloud,
these functions run when some specific event happens. An example of the cloud function
in social media would be a function which at the click of a button opens a URL that receives
the text, audio, or video data and stores it on the server for future use.
It becomes very convenient when all the cloud function is on the root level of the application.
