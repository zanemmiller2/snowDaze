This directory is on the root level will contain all the static assets that are used in the
application, for example, fonts, icons, logos, background images, demo videos, etc.
It is very much recommended that we should have different directories for a different type
of data for example images, videos & logos, should have a different folder of their own so
that it becomes easier to maintain and access them.
